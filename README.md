# dotfiles

## wiisportsresort

these are cool

## installation/usage

files are organized to be used with GNU Stow (probably the `stow` package on your distribution)

```
# pacman -S stow
# apt install stow
# dnf install stow
```

then, use `stow <folder name>` to create symlinks for those dotfiles

## btw

i completely stole from <https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/j3mfc6/i3gaps_ready_for_fall/>
