# dotfiles

## wiisportsresort

these are cool

## installation/usage

if you want wallpapers, initialize submodules:

```
$ git submodule init
```

files are organized to be used with GNU Stow (probably the `stow` package on your distribution)

```
# pacman -S stow
# apt install stow
# dnf install stow
```

then, use `stow <folder name>` to create symlinks for those dotfiles

## btw
